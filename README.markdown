# Color Cycle Example #
A simple project that shows how to use HSB and CCActions to animate a color cycling technique. The demo shows a couple sprites, then adds a CCTintTo action, along with a function to randomly choose a hue, and tween to it.

This uses the code from https://github.com/alessani/ColorConverter for doing the HSB(HSL) conversion to/from RGB/HSL.

Bonus code: I also created a CCAction called CCHSBTo which will tween using HSB instead of RGB. There is very little reason you would want to do this in the real world, but I wanted to see what would happen. :P
